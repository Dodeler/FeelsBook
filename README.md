This is still considered a work in progress.  Some mention of room for improvement (such as in the statistics page) is mentioned.
Strings should not be hard-coded and instead kept in the resource file.  This was more done as a proof of concept choice since,
many of the locations where strings were hard-coded may be removed entirely (negating the benefit of the common string file).
